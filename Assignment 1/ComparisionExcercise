Web Search Engine Comparison

The exercise is about comparing the search results from the two leading US search engines, Google versus Bing.
Many such comparison studies use samples of data, some small and some large, yet no general conclusions can be drawn.
But it is always informative to analyze how the two search engines match up, even on a small data set. 
The process followed was to issue a set of queries and to evaluate the returned results for relevance.
Instead of finding answer to question, which search engine is “best”? 
Rather we stick to more modest research questions which are: 
- Which search engine performs best considering the first five results for a given query? 
- Is there a difference in relevance between the search engines when considering informational 
queries and navigational queries?
