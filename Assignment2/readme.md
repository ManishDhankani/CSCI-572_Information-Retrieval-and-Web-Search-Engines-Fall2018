Your task is to configure and compile the crawler and then have it crawl a news website.
The maximum pages to fetch can be set in crawler4j and it should be set to 20,000 to ensure a reasonable execution time for this exercise. Also, maximum depth should be set to 16 to ensure that we limit the crawling. 
You should crawl only the news websites assigned to you, and your crawler should be configured so that it does not visit pages outside of the given news website!
